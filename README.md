# OOP Game Show
# Day 1
* Today I started on project 4 OOP Game Show.
* I first started by declaring my phrase and game classes withing my `phrase.js` and `game.js` files.
* After that I added my constructor methods: missed, phrases and activePhrase within my game class. Then I tested my code in my `app.js` file.
* I created my `createPhrases()` function within my game class to hold all of my phrases. 
* After that I created my `getRandonPhrase()` to randomly select a phrase. Then I testes my code.
* I didn't really have any issues on Day 1.

# Day 2
* I worked on my `addPhraseToDisplay()` function. This will make the phrase available to the user within the game.
* I ran into an issue testing it. On line 48 of `game.js` said `this line is not a function: phrase.addPhraseToDisplay();`
* Couldn't figure out why that is so I decided to stop there for the night and come back to it the next day.
